# ðŸ§­ Rhino3d AutoHullLines - Hull Sectioning Tool - v1

A Rhino Python script for projecting hull contoursâ€”commonly referred to as Hull Lines, Waterlines, Stations, and Buttocks.

This script allows you to project any polysurface form using metric fractions of the world origin and model boundaries, generating arrays of 3D parametric curves that define the contours.
In the case of Stations the offset is from 0,0 and station offset, Waterlines are positive freeboard and negative draft, Buttocks are CL outwards to Port & Starboard.

This operates on Rhino open and closed polysurfaces and not on meshes as these curves are parametric.

Included is another script to project only a single line at a time following the same method.

## âœ¨ Features

ðŸ”¹ Multi-object selection: Project multiple bodies in one go.

ðŸ”¹ Modular axis control: Choose slicing direction (X, Y, or Z)

ðŸ”¹ Dynamic layer naming: Auto-generates layers per hull and axis

ðŸ”¹ Incremental feedback: Console-driven progress for each hull.

## ðŸš€ Usage

1. Open Rhino and run the script via Python (`EditPythonScript`)
2. Select one or more polysurfaces
3. Choose slicing axis and step size in millimeters
4. Watch contours populate in named layers

## ðŸ§© Requirements

- Rhino 6 or later
- Python scripting enabled (`rhinoscriptsyntax`)
