# ðŸ§­ Rhino3d AutoHullLines - Hull Sectioning Tool - v1

A Rhino Python script for slicing hull geometries into clean sectional contours otherwise known as Hull Lines, Waterlines, Stations and Buttocks.

You can use this script to project any form using fractions, in this case metric, of the world origin & model boundaries to produce arrays of 3d parametric curves that form the contours.

## âœ¨ Features

ðŸ”¹ Multi-object selection: Project multiple bodies in one go.

ðŸ”¹ Modular axis control: Choose slicing direction (X, Y, or Z)

ðŸ”¹ Dynamic layer naming: Auto-generates layers per hull and axis

ðŸ”¹ Incremental feedback: Console-driven progress for each hull.

## ðŸš€ Usage

1. Open Rhino and run the script via Python (`EditPythonScript`)
2. Select one or more polysurfaces
3. Choose slicing axis and step size in millimeters
4. Watch contours populate in named layers

## ðŸ§© Requirements

- Rhino 6 or later
- Python scripting enabled (`rhinoscriptsyntax`)
